# Celestial Objects

Celestial Objects is a project which combines several topics I have learned about recently that 
I thought would be complimentary. These topics are factory patterns and the use of xoroshiro128 
algorithm to create stable randomly generated attributes for objects. I was inspired by one of 
Jason Turner’s YouTube videos about the topic of generating stably random game assets and decided 
to extend the project to include the use of a factory pattern.
